## Dual-Brand Strategy Research

### Key Findings

**No clear examples in chimney cap industry** of manufacturers using separate wholesale/retail brands.

**Successful dual-brand patterns from other industries:**

**1. House of Brands Approach (GAP Model):**
- Parent company oversees sub-brands
- Each brand has independent identity
- Example: GAP → Old Navy (value), Banana Republic (premium), Athleta (activewear)

**2. Shared Infrastructure:**
- Manufacturing, storage, supply chain shared
- Marketing channels kept separate
- Each brand requires individual creative/effort

**3. Pharmaceutical Model (Dual Formulation):**
- Same parent company
- Different formulations (oral vs. topical)
- Separate brand identities for different use cases

**4. FMCG Example (Unilever):**
- Hero products (Dove, Axe) get focused investment
- Other brands (Noxzema, Living Proof) continue separately
- All share production facilities

### Application to Water Ways

**Recommended Approach:**

**Parent Company (Water Ways Sheet Metal):**
- Manufacturer identity visible
- B2B relationships, custom work
- Can reference wholesale brand subtly

**Wholesale Brand (TBD):**
- Independent brand identity
- Can mention "manufactured in USA" without naming manufacturer
- Focus: Distributors, contractors, professionals
- May have subtle link to parent company ("A Water Ways brand" or similar)

**Retail Brand (TBD):**
- COMPLETELY independent identity
- No visible connection to manufacturer or wholesale brand
- Consumer-facing, premium positioning
- Story-driven marketing (craftsmanship, quality, protection)
