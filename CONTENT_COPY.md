### Our Craftsmanship Philosophy Section

**Section Headline:**
Quality That Protects Your Investment

**Body Copy:**
At Water Ways, we don't believe in "bargain" solutions. We've seen too many properties suffer costly water damage from inferior materials and rushed workmanship. Water penetration issues might not surface for months or years—but when they do, the repair costs far exceed the initial savings from choosing cheap alternatives.

That's why we specialize in premium materials like copper and Rheinzink. These aren't just beautiful materials—they're proven performers with century-long track records. When you invest in custom metalwork from Water Ways, you're choosing:

**The Right Material**
Copper and Rheinzink offer unmatched durability, developing protective patinas that actually improve with age. These materials don't just survive harsh weather—they thrive in it.

**The Right Technique**
We blend modern CNC precision with traditional hand-forming skills passed down through generations. This hybrid approach ensures perfect fit, superior function, and lasting beauty.

**The Right Approach**
Every project is custom-fabricated to your exact specifications. We don't sell one-size-fits-most products. We create solutions designed specifically for your property's unique requirements.

**The Right Communication**
From initial consultation to final delivery, you'll work directly with Ray and Natalie. We send progress photos, answer questions promptly, and ensure you're informed every step of the way.

This commitment to quality isn't just philosophy—it's how we've built a reputation that brings customers from across the country to a small shop on the Arkansas-Oklahoma border.

**What We'll Discuss:**
- Your goals and vision for the project
- Functional requirements (water protection, structural considerations)
- Aesthetic preferences (style, finish, design elements)
- Timeline expectations
- Budget parameters

**For Local Projects:**
⚠️ [Ray - Do you offer site visits? What's the radius?] We can schedule a site visit to take precise measurements and assess the installation conditions.

---

#### Phase 2: Design & Engineering

**Timeline:**
⚠️ [Ray - Typical turnaround for quotes?] Most quotes are provided within [TBD: 2-3 business days?].

---

#### Phase 3: Fabrication

**What Happens:**
Once you approve the design and quote, we begin fabrication. Your project moves through our shop in carefully controlled stages:

**CNC Cutting:**
Precision cutting ensures perfect dimensions and clean edges. Our CNC equipment handles complex patterns and shapes with accuracy measured in thousandths of an inch.

**Hand-Forming:**
Traditional metalworking techniques shape copper and sheet metal into three-dimensional forms. This is where artistry meets engineering—creating curves, angles, and details that machines alone cannot achieve.

**Welding & Assembly:**
Expert welding joins components into cohesive, watertight structures. Every seam is carefully formed to ensure both structural integrity and clean aesthetics.

**Finishing:**
We apply patina treatments ⚠️ [if requested], perform final quality inspections, and ensure every detail meets our standards.

**Progress Updates:**
We'll send photos throughout fabrication so you can see your project taking shape. Have questions or want to see a specific detail? Just ask.

**Timeline:**
⚠️ [Ray - Provide typical timelines:]
- Standard chimney caps: [TBD: 2-3 weeks?]
- Complex custom projects: [TBD: 4-6 weeks?]

---

#### Phase 4: Finishing & Quality Control

**What Happens:**
Before your project leaves our shop, it undergoes rigorous quality control:

- Dimensional accuracy verification
- Visual inspection for finish quality
- Structural integrity testing
- Proper patina development (if applicable)
- Final detail refinement

Nothing ships until we're satisfied it represents our best work.

---

#### Phase 5: Packaging & Delivery

We build custom wood crates specifically for your metalwork. Proper crating ensures your fabrication arrives in perfect condition, no matter the distance.

**Local Installation:**
⚠️ [Ray - Service radius for installation?] For projects within [TBD: specify radius or region], we offer professional installation services. Our team ensures proper placement, secure attachment, and optimal performance.

**Nationwide Shipping:**
We ship via trusted common carriers to all 50 states. Most shipments arrive [TBD: within 7-10 business days?] ⚠️. Tracking information is provided so you know exactly when to expect delivery.

**Installation Support:**

### Why Copper Section

**Section Headline:**
Why We Love Working with Copper

**Section Intro:**
Copper isn't just our specialty—it's the gold standard for architectural metalwork. Here's why we recommend copper for projects that demand the best.

#### Lifetime Durability

**Body Copy:**
Copper metalwork lasts 100+ years with minimal maintenance. Unlike painted steel that rusts or aluminum that corrodes, copper actually becomes more durable over time as it develops a protective patina. Historical copper roofs and details from the 1800s remain functional and beautiful today—that's the kind of longevity we build into every project.

---

#### Beautiful Natural Patina

**Body Copy:**
New copper gleams with warm, bright metallic luster. Over time, exposure to weather develops a natural patina—from rich browns and bronzes to the classic verde green seen on historic buildings. This patina isn't damage; it's a self-healing protective layer that enhances beauty while defending against corrosion. Want to accelerate or customize patina development? We can apply treatments to achieve specific colors and finishes.

**Image Gallery:** Show patina progression from bright copper → brown → verde green

---

#### Antimicrobial Properties

**Body Copy:**
Copper naturally inhibits bacterial growth—a property recognized for thousands of years and proven by modern science. For applications like interior metalwork, sinks, and high-touch surfaces, copper provides inherent hygiene benefits that other metals cannot match.

---

#### Sustainability

**Body Copy:**
Copper is 100% recyclable without loss of quality. When (if ever) a copper installation needs replacement after its century-long service life, the material maintains full value and can be recycled indefinitely. Choosing copper means choosing sustainable building practices.

---

#### Workability & Beauty

**Body Copy:**
From a craftsman's perspective, copper is the ideal material. It's workable enough for complex hand-forming yet strong enough for structural applications. It accepts welding, brazing, and soldering beautifully. It can be left natural or finished with patinas. And it never looks cheap—copper brings inherent elegance to every installation.

---

#### Investment Value

**Body Copy:**
Yes, copper costs more upfront than bargain alternatives. But consider the lifecycle value:

- **No repainting** (ever)
- **No rust or corrosion** protection needed
- **Minimal maintenance** required
- **100+ year lifespan** vs. 10-20 years for inferior materials
- **Prevents water damage** that costs thousands to repair
- **Increases property value** with distinctive architectural details

When you calculate true cost-per-year of ownership, copper is often the most economical choice—and always the most beautiful.

#### Introduction Section

**Headline:**
Why Your Chimney Needs a Custom Cap

**Body Copy:**
A quality chimney cap does more than top off your chimney—it's essential protection that prevents costly damage and dangerous conditions:

**Stops Water Penetration**
Rain and snow entering your chimney deteriorate masonry, rust dampers, stain walls, and cause thousands in structural damage. A properly fitted copper cap provides lifetime weather protection.

**Blocks Animals & Debris**
Birds, squirrels, raccoons, and even bats love dark chimney flues. A custom cap with proper screening keeps wildlife out while allowing proper draft for safe fireplace and furnace operation.

**Prevents Downdrafts**
Wind can create downdrafts that blow smoke and gases back into your home. Well-designed chimney caps minimize this issue while maintaining proper ventilation.

**Stops Sparks & Embers**
Mesh screening catches sparks and embers that could ignite roof materials or nearby vegetation—critical protection in areas prone to wildfires or with combustible roofing.

**Why Custom Matters**
Off-the-shelf chimney caps rarely fit properly. Gaps allow water and animals to enter. Improper sizing can restrict draft and create dangerous carbon monoxide situations. At Water Ways, every chimney cap is custom-fabricated to your exact chimney dimensions—ensuring perfect fit, proper function, and lifetime protection.

---

#### Materials We Work With Section

**Section Headline:**
Premium Materials for Lifetime Performance

**Section Intro:**
We specialize in materials that protect your home for generations, not just years.

##### Material 1: Copper (Featured)

**Headline:** Copper - Our Signature Material

**Body Copy:**
Copper is the gold standard for chimney caps, and it's our specialty. Here's why discerning homeowners choose copper:

**Lifetime Durability:** Copper chimney caps last 100+ years with zero maintenance. The protective patina that develops actually makes copper more durable over time.

**Natural Beauty:** New copper gleams with warm metallic luster. Over months and years, it develops rich brown and bronze tones, eventually achieving the classic verde green patina seen on historic buildings. This transformation adds character while providing superior protection.

**Perfect Fit:** Copper's workability allows us to craft complex curves and architectural details that other materials cannot achieve. From simple rain caps to elaborate French curve designs, copper forms beautifully.

**Investment Value:** Yes, copper costs more initially. But with a century-long lifespan and zero maintenance, it's the most economical choice per year of ownership—and it increases property value.

**Image:** Copper chimney cap showing patina development

---

##### Material 2: Stainless Steel

**Headline:** Stainless Steel - Modern & Durable

**Body Copy:**
For projects requiring contemporary aesthetics or specific corrosion resistance, stainless steel delivers:

**Corrosion Resistant:** Marine-grade stainless steel withstands harsh coastal environments and industrial atmospheres where even copper can be challenged.

**Modern Aesthetic:** Bright metallic finish complements contemporary architecture and provides clean, precise appearance.

**Cost-Effective:** Lower material cost than copper while still providing decades of durable service.

**Available finishes:** Brushed, polished, or mill finish depending on your aesthetic preferences.

**Image:** Stainless steel chimney cap installation

---

##### Material 3: Rheinzink

**Headline:** Rheinzink - European Quality

**Body Copy:**
Rheinzink is a premium zinc-titanium alloy from Germany, combining beauty and performance:

**Self-Healing Patina:** Like copper, zinc develops a protective patina—but in elegant blue-gray tones that complement both traditional and modern architecture.

**Exceptional Longevity:** 70+ year lifespan with minimal maintenance.

**Sustainability:** Zinc is 100% recyclable and requires less energy to produce than most metals.

**Distinctive Appearance:** For those who love the patina concept but want an alternative to copper's verde green, zinc offers sophisticated gray-blue weathering.

**Image:** Rheinzink chimney cap or architectural detail

---

#### Introduction Section

**Headline:**
Flashing: The Unsung Hero of Weather Protection

**Body Copy:**
Flashing might be the least visible element of your home's exterior—but it's one of the most critical. Properly installed copper or sheet metal flashing prevents water penetration at vulnerable transitions: where walls meet roofs, where chimneys penetrate roofing, where bay windows project from walls.

When flashing fails, water infiltrates walls, damages insulation, rots framing, stains interiors, and creates expensive structural problems that compound over time. The worst part? Water damage often goes unnoticed until it's severe—and expensive to repair.

At Water Ways Sheet Metal, we specialize in custom flashing fabrication that provides lifetime protection:

**Custom-Fabricated:** Every piece cut and formed to your exact specifications
**Premium Materials:** Copper and Rheinzink that outlast your structure
**Expert Installation:** ⚠️ [If you offer installation] Proper technique ensures watertight performance
**Architectural Integration:** Flashing that protects without compromising aesthetics

Don't trust critical water protection to generic products. Invest in custom flashing that performs flawlessly for generations.

#### Types of Flashing Section

**Section Headline:**
Comprehensive Flashing Solutions

**Section Intro:**
From simple roof penetrations to complex architectural details, we fabricate flashing for every application.

##### Through-Wall Flashing

**Headline:** Through-Wall Masonry Flashing

**Body Copy:**
Critical protection for brick veneer and masonry construction. Through-wall flashing installed behind exterior masonry directs water that penetrates the outer layer safely out through weep holes—preventing moisture from reaching structural framing and interior walls.

**Applications:**
- Brick veneer residential construction
- Commercial masonry buildings
- Stone facade installations
- Multi-wythe masonry walls

**Why Copper?**
Through-wall flashing is nearly impossible to replace without demolishing masonry. Copper's 100+ year lifespan ensures your flashing outlasts the structure itself.

##### Chimney Flashing

**Headline:** Chimney Flashing

**Body Copy:**
The intersection of chimney and roof is one of the most vulnerable areas for water penetration. Proper chimney flashing requires both base flashing (sealed to chimney) and step flashing (integrated with roofing)—working together to channel water safely away.

**Our Approach:**
- Custom-fitted to your chimney dimensions
- Proper overlap and integration with roofing
- Counter-flashing embedded in mortar joints
- Designed for your specific roof pitch and material

**Image:** Chimney flashing detail or installation

**Section Headline:**
Flashing Materials That Last

##### Copper Flashing

**Body Copy:**
Copper is our preferred flashing material for critical applications. Its 100+ year lifespan, workability for complex shapes, and ability to develop protective patina make it ideal for areas where replacement is difficult or impossible (like through-wall flashing). Copper won't rust, doesn't require painting, and maintains integrity through decades of expansion/contraction cycles.

##### Rheinzink Flashing

**Body Copy:**
Rheinzink offers similar longevity to copper with distinctive blue-gray patina. Excellent choice for contemporary architecture or when you prefer zinc's aesthetic over copper's verde green.

##### Stainless Steel Flashing

**Body Copy:**
For specific applications requiring different aesthetics or material properties, stainless steel provides corrosion resistance and modern appearance.

---

#### Installation Considerations Section

**Section Headline:**
Proper Installation Matters

**Body Copy:**
⚠️ [Ray - Do you offer flashing installation services? If so, describe approach and service radius]

Even the best flashing material fails if improperly installed. Successful flashing requires:

**Proper Overlap:** Flashing pieces must overlap in directions that channel water correctly
**Secure Attachment:** Appropriate fasteners and methods for each application
**Sealant Application:** Quality sealants applied at critical junctions
**Integration with Roofing:** Flashing must work with roofing materials, not against them
**Code Compliance:** All installations meet or exceed building codes

For local projects, [TBD: we offer professional installation] ⚠️. For projects beyond our service area, we can recommend qualified installers or provide detailed installation specifications for your contractor.

#### Material Benefits Section

**Section Headline:**
Why Choose Copper Roofing?

##### Unmatched Longevity

**Body Copy:**
Copper roofs last 100+ years—often outlasting the structures they protect. This isn't marketing hyperbole; it's demonstrated by thousands of historic copper roofs still performing after 150+ years. No other roofing material comes close to this lifespan.

##### Zero Maintenance

**Body Copy:**
Copper roofing requires no painting, coating, or protective treatments. The natural patina that develops actually protects copper from corrosion. Unlike other materials that deteriorate, copper improves with age.

##### Beautiful Patina Development

**Body Copy:**
New copper gleams with bright metallic luster. Over 5-20 years (depending on climate), it develops rich brown and bronze tones, eventually achieving the classic verde green patina. This transformation adds character and confirms proper aging.

##### Investment Value

**Body Copy:**
Calculate copper's cost per year of service: A copper roof costing 3-4x more than asphalt but lasting 5-6x longer is actually more economical—plus it never needs replacement, avoids re-roofing labor costs, and increases property value significantly.

##### Sustainability

**Body Copy:**
Copper is 100% recyclable without quality loss. At end of service life (if that ever comes), copper roofing retains significant material value and can be recycled indefinitely. Compare that to asphalt shingles filling landfills every 15-20 years.

---

#### Design Considerations Section

**Section Headline:**
Planning Your Copper Roof

**Body Copy:**
Copper roofing is a significant investment that requires thoughtful planning:

**Roof Structure:**
Copper is lighter than asphalt shingles, so existing structures typically support copper without modification. However, standing seam systems require solid decking or closely spaced purlins.

**Architectural Style:**
Copper complements virtually all architectural styles—from historic Victorian to contemporary modern. We'll help design copper roofing that enhances your specific architecture.

**Patina Expectations:**
Understand copper's color evolution. If you want to preserve bright copper appearance, clear coatings can slow patina (though they require reapplication). Most clients embrace the natural patina process for its beauty and protective benefits.

**Installation Requirements:**

### MATERIALS & PRODUCTS

#### Q5: What materials do you work with?

**Answer:**
We specialize in premium materials known for longevity and beauty:

**Copper (Our Specialty):**
Our primary focus and area of expertise. Copper offers 100+ year lifespan, beautiful patina development, and unmatched durability for architectural metalwork.

**Rheinzink (Zinc-Titanium Alloy):**
European-quality zinc alloy that develops distinctive blue-gray patina. Excellent for contemporary architecture or when you prefer zinc's aesthetic over copper's verde green.

**Stainless Steel:**
Marine-grade stainless provides modern appearance and corrosion resistance for specific applications.

⚠️ [Ray - Confirm if you also work with aluminum and mild steel]

We work exclusively with premium materials—we don't offer bargain alternatives that compromise performance or longevity.

---

#### Q6: Why is copper better than other materials?

**Answer:**
Copper offers advantages that other materials simply cannot match:

**Lifetime Durability:** Copper lasts 100+ years with minimal maintenance. Historic copper installations from the 1800s remain functional today. Compare that to galvanized steel (10-15 years) or even stainless steel (40-50 years).

**Self-Healing Patina:** The natural patina that develops on copper actually protects it from corrosion—it's not deterioration, it's preservation. This patina makes copper MORE durable over time.

**Zero Rust:** Unlike ferrous metals, copper doesn't rust. No rust stains on walls, no structural deterioration, no coating or painting required.

**Workability:** Copper forms beautifully for complex shapes and detailed work. This allows us to create custom designs that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive in other materials.

**Investment Value:** Yes, copper costs more initially. But when you calculate cost per year of service life and account for zero maintenance, copper is often the most economical choice—and it adds significant property value.

**Sustainability:** Copper is 100% recyclable without quality loss. At end of its long service life, it retains material value.

For critical applications like through-wall flashing (nearly impossible to replace), chimney caps (expensive to replace), and architectural elements (intended to last), copper is the smart investment.

---

#### Q7: What is Rheinzink?

**Answer:**
Rheinzink is a premium zinc-titanium alloy manufactured in Germany. It combines 99.95% zinc with small amounts of titanium and copper to create a material with exceptional properties:

**Longevity:** 70+ year expected lifespan with minimal maintenance

**Self-Healing Patina:** Like copper, zinc develops a protective patina—but in elegant blue-gray tones instead of verde green

**Sustainability:** Zinc requires less energy to produce than most metals and is 100% recyclable

**European Quality:** Rheinzink maintains strict manufacturing standards for consistent quality

**Workability:** Excellent forming properties for custom fabrication

Rheinzink is ideal for contemporary architecture or projects where you appreciate the patina concept but prefer gray-blue tones over copper's classic green.

---

#### Q8: Do you offer stainless steel options?

**Answer:**
Yes, we fabricate chimney caps, flashing, and other metalwork in marine-grade stainless steel. Stainless is an excellent choice when:

- You prefer modern metallic appearance over patina development
- Your project is in harsh coastal environment (salt air)
- You need specific corrosion resistance properties
- Budget requires more economical alternative to copper while maintaining quality
- Contemporary architecture calls for stainless aesthetic

Stainless steel offers 40-50+ year lifespan, corrosion resistance, and clean appearance. While it doesn't match copper's century-long performance, it's dramatically superior to galvanized or painted steel alternatives.

---

#### Q9: Will my copper chimney cap turn green?

**Answer:**
Yes—eventually. And that's a GOOD thing!

Copper naturally develops patina through weathering:

**Years 0-5:** Bright metallic copper gradually darkens to rich browns and bronzes
**Years 5-15:** Brown/bronze tones deepen; may show hints of green
**Years 15-25+:** Classic verde green patina fully develops

**Patina Development Factors:**
- Climate (coastal areas develop green patina faster)
- Exposure (direct weather vs. protected)
- Orientation (south-facing vs. north-facing)
- Pollution levels
- Regional weather patterns

**Important: Patina Is Protection**
The verde green patina isn't damage or corrosion—it's a protective layer (copper carbonate) that shields the copper beneath from further weathering. This is why copper can last 100+ years—the patina preserves it.

**Prefer Different Appearance?**
- We can apply pre-patina treatments for brown, bronze, or verde finishes
- Clear coatings can slow (but not prevent) patina development
- Most clients embrace natural patina evolution for its beauty and historical authenticity

---

#### Q10: Can you match existing copper patina?

**Answer:**
Yes! If you're adding to existing copper elements or replacing a section, we can apply patina treatments to closely match surrounding copper. While we can't control how new copper will weather over time, we can give it a head start that blends reasonably well with aged copper.

Bring photos of your existing copper, and we'll discuss patina matching options. Perfect matching is challenging (every copper surface ages uniquely), but we can usually achieve close approximation that harmonizes well—especially since the new copper will continue developing its own natural patina.

[Option 1 - If yes with radius:]
Yes, we provide professional installation services for projects within [TBD: specify radius, e.g., "50 miles of Siloam Springs" or "Northwest Arkansas region" or "4-state area"]. Our team ensures proper installation for optimal performance and longevity.

#### Q21: Can I pick up my order?

**Answer:**
⚠️ [Ray - Do you allow customer pickup? Prefer shipping? Crating charges if picked up?]

[If yes:]
Yes, customers are welcome to pick up completed projects from our shop in Watts, Oklahoma. This can save shipping costs on smaller items. Contact us when your project is complete to schedule pickup.

For fragile or large items, we still recommend professional shipping in custom crates to prevent damage during transport.

[If prefer shipping:]
We prefer to ship custom-fabricated metalwork in professional crating to ensure it arrives in perfect condition. Our custom wood crates protect your investment during transport—important for copper and finished metalwork that can be damaged by improper handling.

Local customers within [X miles] may arrange pickup for some items.

---

#### Q22: Do you ship nationwide?

**Answer:**
Yes! We regularly ship custom metalwork to all 50 states. Past projects have been delivered to Minnesota, Ohio, North Carolina, and many other states coast to coast.

**Our Shipping Process:**

**Custom Crating:**
We build custom wood crates specifically for your project. Proper crating prevents damage during shipping—copper and finished metalwork must be protected from scratching, denting, and rough handling.

**Common Carrier Shipping:**
We ship via reliable freight carriers. You'll receive tracking information so you know exactly when to expect delivery.

**Delivery Timing:**
⚠️ [Ray - typical shipping timeframes?] Most shipments arrive within [TBD: 7-10 business days?] depending on destination.

**Shipping Costs:**
Shipping and crating costs vary by project size, weight, and destination. These costs are included in your detailed quote.

**Delivery Condition:**
Our careful crating ensures your metalwork arrives in perfect condition, ready for installation. As testimonials from Minnesota, Ohio, and North Carolina customers confirm—Water Ways shipments arrive safely.

---

#### Q23: How is shipping calculated?

**Answer:**
Shipping costs depend on several factors:

**Weight & Dimensions:**
Heavier and larger items cost more to ship. Oversized items may require special freight handling.

**Destination:**
Distance from our Oklahoma location affects freight costs. Cross-country shipments cost more than regional deliveries.

**Crating Requirements:**
Custom wood crate construction is included in shipping costs. Complex projects requiring special crating (very large items, fragile finishes) may have higher crating costs.

**Freight Service Level:**
Standard freight delivery to commercial addresses with loading docks is most economical. Residential delivery or liftgate service (if required) adds cost.

We provide exact shipping costs in your project quote—no surprises. Shipping charges cover both crating materials/labor and freight carrier fees.

### MAINTENANCE & CARE

#### Q24: How do I maintain my copper chimney cap?

**Answer:**
The beauty of copper is how little maintenance it requires:

**Normal Maintenance: ZERO**

Copper chimney caps require no painting, no sealing, no protective coatings, and no regular maintenance. The natural patina that develops is self-protecting—you don't need to do anything.

**Optional Maintenance:**

**Clear Debris:** Occasionally check that screening (if present) isn't clogged with leaves or debris that could restrict draft. A simple brush-off once a year is sufficient.

**Inspect Attachment:** Every few years, visually inspect that your cap remains securely attached. Properly installed copper caps should remain secure indefinitely, but it's good practice to verify.

**That's It:**
Unlike painted steel caps that need repainting or galvanized caps that rust and require replacement, copper performs for decades with essentially zero attention.

**Don't "Clean" Copper Patina:**
Some people think patina needs to be cleaned or removed—it doesn't. Patina is PROTECTION, not dirt. Removing patina (by polishing or chemical treatment) actually harms copper's longevity. Let it age naturally.

---

#### Q25: What's the lifespan of copper metalwork?

**Answer:**
Copper metalwork lasts 100+ years—often outlasting the structures it protects.

This isn't an estimate or marketing claim—it's demonstrated by thousands of historic copper installations:

- Copper roofs from the 1800s remain functional today
- Copper flashing in century-old buildings still prevents water penetration
- Copper architectural details on historic structures look beautiful after 150+ years

**Why Copper Lasts So Long:**

**Self-Protecting Patina:** The natural patina that develops makes copper MORE durable, not less. It's a protective layer that prevents corrosion.

**No Rust:** Copper doesn't contain iron, so it can't rust. This is why copper outlasts steel by 5-10x.

**Stable Material:** Copper doesn't degrade, become brittle, or lose structural integrity over time like many materials do.

**Quality Fabrication Matters:** Properly fabricated copper metalwork with appropriate thickness and correct installation techniques achieves this century-long performance. Cheap copper or improper installation can compromise longevity.

**Your Water Ways Metalwork:**
When you invest in custom copper fabrication from Water Ways, you're quite literally installing metalwork that could serve your home, your children's homes, and your grandchildren's homes. That's why we take craftsmanship so seriously—we're building for multiple lifetimes.

#### Q26: Do you offer warranties?

**Answer:**
⚠️ [Ray - CRITICAL: Define your warranty policy]

[Placeholder - needs Ray's input on:]
- Do you warranty craftsmanship? For how long?
- Do you warranty materials? (Copper's longevity is inherent, but do you guarantee thickness, quality, etc.?)
- What does warranty cover? (Defects in fabrication? Material defects?)
- What does warranty NOT cover? (Installation by others? Damage during shipping if customer arranged shipping? Acts of God?)
- How are warranty claims handled?

**Example framework (revise based on Ray's policy):**
