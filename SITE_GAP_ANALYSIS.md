   - Which portfolio projects should be showcased first?
   - Are installation process photos critical for customers?

3. **Content Priority:**
   - Are subcategory pages (chimney pots, rain chain, etc.) important for SEO?

## Risk Assessment

### Risks of Launching with Current Gaps:

**High Risk:**
- ‚ùå Image-light site doesn't showcase work quality (portfolio = lead generation)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Perception of smaller operation than existing site conveys

**Low Risk:**
- üü¢ Modern design may compensate for less content
- üü¢ Better UX (FAQ, form) may increase conversions despite fewer images
- üü¢ Static site performance boost may offset content gaps

## Conclusion

Phase 0 analysis reveals that while our new site has superior design, UX, and technical foundation, we have significant content and image gaps compared to the existing site. The existing site's strength is its comprehensive visual portfolio (350+ images across 26 pages), which we've under-represented in our rebuild (18 images across 9 pages).

**Critical Decision Needed:** Choose launch strategy (Option A, B, or C) to balance speed-to-market with content completeness.

**Recommendation:** Start with **Option A (Quick Launch with Core Content)** to get a modern, functional site live quickly, then iterate based on analytics and customer feedback. The existing site isn't going anywhere - we can use it as a reference while migrating content in phases post-launch.
