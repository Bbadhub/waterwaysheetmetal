## Strategic Direction: CONVERSION-FOCUSED

### Core Philosophy
**"Every page is a landing page, every section tells our story, every interaction moves toward a quote request."**

### Key Principles
1. **Continuous CTAs:** Multiple conversion opportunities on every page
2. **Story-Driven:** Each section advances the narrative (problem → solution → proof → action)
3. **Funnel-Based:** Guide users from awareness → consideration → decision → action
4. **Solution-Oriented:** Frame everything as solving customer problems
5. **Visual Proof:** Images showcase solutions, not just pretty metal
6. **Trust Signals:** Social proof at every decision point

## Conversion Funnel Architecture

### THE FUNNEL

```
AWARENESS (Top of Funnel)
    ↓
Problem Recognition: "I need a custom chimney cap that won't leak"
    ↓
INTEREST (Middle of Funnel)
    ↓
Solution Discovery: "Water Ways custom-fabricates copper caps"
    ↓
CONSIDERATION (Middle of Funnel)
    ↓
Proof & Trust: Testimonials, process, quality evidence
    ↓
DECISION (Bottom of Funnel)
    ↓
Clear Action: "Request a Quote" / "Call Now"
    ↓
CONVERSION
```

### How Every Page Supports the Funnel

**Homepage:** Awareness → Interest → Action

- **Decision:** "Request a Quote" CTA

**Service Pages:** Interest → Consideration → Decision

## CTA Strategy: Multiple Touchpoints

### CTA Hierarchy

**Primary CTA:** "Request a Free Quote" (lead generation)
**Secondary CTA:** "Call (479) 957-3794" (immediate contact)
**Tertiary CTA:** "View Our Work" / "Learn More" (nurture)

### CTA Placement Formula

**Every Page Must Have:**
1. **Header CTA:** Visible at all times (sticky header)
2. **Hero CTA:** Above the fold, first action opportunity
3. **Mid-Page CTA:** After establishing value (proof section)
4. **Final CTA:** Last chance before leaving page
5. **Footer CTA:** Always available
