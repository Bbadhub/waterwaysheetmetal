- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Backlog items:** Non-blocking enhancements that can be added iteratively
- üîÑ **Continuous improvement:** Site launches lean, gets enhanced over time

## Backlog Strategy

### When to Address Backlog Items

**During Sprint (Opportunistic):**
- If Ray provides information unsolicited
- If development time available between phases
- If quick wins emerge (5-10 minute items)

**Post-Launch (Iterative):**
- After site is live and generating leads
- During content refresh cycles
- When Ray has time for photo session
- As Arkansas projects are completed (add to portfolio)

**Never Required:**
- None of these items block launch
- Site is fully functional without them
- Enhancements improve conversion but aren't essential

---

## Backlog in Sprint System

**Location:** `sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml` - BACKLOG section
**Status Field:** `status = "backlog"` (distinct from "pending", "in_progress", "completed")
**Launch Blocker:** `blocked_by_launch = false` (all backlog items)
**Post-Launch:** `can_update_post_launch = true` (all backlog items)

**Pattern:** Pattern-CONTEXT-002 applied to all backlog tasks with full CoT reasoning

---

## Summary

**14 backlog tasks identified** representing ~8-11 hours of Ray's time if all completed.

**Key Insight:** None are required for successful launch. Site can go live and generate leads with Week 1 deliverables alone.

**Approach:** Launch lean, iterate based on:
- Ray's availability
- Conversion data (which enhancements matter most?)
- Seasonal opportunity (photo session in good weather)
- Arkansas project completion (add to portfolio for local SEO)

**Philosophy:** Backlog prevents perfectionism paralysis. Ship functional site, enhance iteratively.

---

**Status:** Backlog phase created and documented ‚úÖ
**Next:** Continue Week 2 Design phase without waiting for backlog items
