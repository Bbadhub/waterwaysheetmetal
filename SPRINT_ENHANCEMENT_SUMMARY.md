## Example: Chain of Thought Structure

### Task PLAN-001: Gather Business Information from Ray

**Why:**
```
Need complete business details to implement proper Schema markup (LocalBusiness).
Missing information blocks content writing for about page and contact page.
Geographic/service area data critical for local SEO targeting (Northwest Arkansas, OK, MO, KS).
```

**Context:**
```
WATERWAYS_BUILD_PLAN.md identifies this as Priority 1 (Information Gathering).
COMPETITIVE_RESEARCH_REPORT.md shows competitors emphasize "Made in USA", facility location, years of experience.
Current site has limited business info - just phone/email (no address, hours, team details visible).
```

**Reasoning Chain:**
```
1. WATERWAYS_SITE_ARCHITECTURE.md requires Schema LocalBusiness markup
2. LocalBusiness schema needs: address, phone, hours, geo coordinates
3. About page needs: founding year, team details, certifications
4. KEYWORD_RESEARCH.md targets local geo keywords (Arkansas, Siloam Springs, Northwest Arkansas)
5. Local SEO requires accurate NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency
6. Competitor sites (Chim Cap Corp) showcase 40+ years experience, facility details
7. Ray is primary contact: (479) 957-3794 | Ray@WaterwaysSheetMetal.com
8. Result: Single information gathering session → unblocks content, Schema, SEO
```

**Success Impact:**
```
When PLAN-001 complete:
✅ All business details documented in one central place
✅ Schema LocalBusiness markup can be implemented (PLAN-001 → DEV-005)
✅ About page content can be written (PLAN-001 → PLAN-004)
✅ Contact page accurate (PLAN-001 → DEV-001)
✅ Local SEO foundation established (geographic targeting)
✅ Credibility signals identified (years in business, certifications)
```
