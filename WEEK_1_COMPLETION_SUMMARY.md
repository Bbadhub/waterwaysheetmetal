## Blocking Items Requiring Ray's Action

### Priority 1: Critical for Schema & SEO (PLAN-001)
1. ❌ GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude)
2. ❌ Hours of operation
3. ❌ Year founded
4. ❌ Complete business address confirmation

**Impact:** Blocks LocalBusiness Schema implementation (DEV-005)

### Priority 2: Essential for About Page (PLAN-001 + PLAN-004)
5. ❌ Team size and structure
6. ❌ Ray & Natalie personal bios (years experience, background)
7. ❌ Detailed founding story
8. ❌ Licenses, certifications, trade associations

**Impact:** About page incomplete without personal narratives

### Priority 3: Portfolio Content (PLAN-003)
9. ❌ Select 8-11 additional projects (especially Arkansas projects)
10. ❌ Provide project photos (3-10 per project)
11. ❌ Project details (location, date, materials, description)

**Impact:** Portfolio page cannot be built without project content

### Priority 4: Visual Assets (PLAN-002)
12. ❌ Schedule photo session (team, facility, process documentation)
13. ❌ Existing image download (or provide access to WordPress media library)

**Impact:** Site lacks humanizing visual elements (team, workspace)

### Priority 5: Copy Personalization (PLAN-004)
14. ❌ Review and approve 16,000 words of copy
15. ❌ Fill in [TBD] items (timelines, payment terms, warranties)

**Impact:** Copy is 85% done but needs Ray's voice and specific details

## Sprint Timeline Update

- **Week 5:** Testing & Refinement
- **Week 6:** Launch & Post-Launch

### Current Reality (End of Week 1)
**Week 1 Status:** 54% complete (strong foundation, Ray-dependent items identified)

**Revised Approach:**
- **Week 1 (current):** Foundational planning complete, awaiting Ray's input
- **Week 1-2 overlap:** Parallel tracks:

  - Track B: Ray provides missing info → finalize Week 1 tasks
- **Week 2-3:** Design finalization + begin development with available content
- **Week 3-4:** Development continues + integrate Ray's input
- **Week 5:** Testing & refinement
- **Week 6:** Launch

**Assessment:** We're slightly ahead on content creation (16K words written!) but need Ray's time investment for personalization and project selection. Non-blocking design work can proceed in parallel.
