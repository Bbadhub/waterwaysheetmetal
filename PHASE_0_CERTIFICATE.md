## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong Initially
1. **Surface-Level Analysis:** First pass captured only homepage showcase (18 images)
2. **Underestimated Content Depth:** Didn't explore all navigation subpages
3. **Gallery Assumption:** Assumed WordPress gallery was small, actually has 30+ directories
4. **Launch Readiness:** Nearly launched with 95% less visual content than existing site

### What Phase 0 Solved
1. **Complete Discovery:** Systematic page-by-page analysis captured everything
2. **Evidence-Based Planning:** Gap analysis provides clear decision framework
3. **Risk Mitigation:** Prevented launching incomplete site that would confuse existing customers
4. **Stakeholder Decision Support:** Three concrete launch options with effort estimates

### Best Practices Validated
- ‚úÖ Always do comprehensive audit BEFORE rebuilding
- ‚úÖ Don't rely on memory or assumptions
- ‚úÖ Document everything (pages, images, content, features)
- ‚úÖ Gap analysis before launch prevents costly rework
- ‚úÖ Pause and assess when local testing reveals issues

## Decision Point: Launch Strategy

### Stakeholder Question
**Which launch option aligns with business goals?**

**Option A: Quick Launch (2-3 days)**
- Pro: Modern design live quickly, iterate based on feedback
- Con: Less visual depth than existing site initially
- Best For: "Ship fast, improve continuously" mindset

**Option B: Full Parity (1-2 weeks)**
- Pro: Complete feature parity + modern improvements
- Con: More time to launch, but comprehensive
- Best For: "Launch when it's truly done" mindset

**Option C: Exceed Existing (3-4 weeks)**
- Pro: New site significantly better than existing in every dimension
- Con: Longest timeline, risk of scope creep
- Best For: "Make it the best it can be" mindset

### Recommendation
**Start with Option A** (Quick Launch) to get modern design live, then iterate based on:
- Analytics data (which pages get most traffic?)
- Customer feedback (what content do they request?)
- Lead generation results (which images/pages convert?)

The existing site remains live as reference - no content is lost, just prioritized differently.
